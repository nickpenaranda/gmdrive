TODO
====

* 3-2-1-Go indicators at the beginning of simulation
* Delay before start
* Reset button(s) that 1. restart entire scenario, 2. return to last waypoint (or start point)
* Visible timer
* Render "ideal path"
* Engine noise/road noise (see TORCS implementation for this)
* Output continuous data to disk
* Waypoint transitions from pulsed sound to continuous sound when critically near.  At a certain
  distance, arrival chime sounds and next waypoint is presented
* More advanced camera movement, speed based zoom?
